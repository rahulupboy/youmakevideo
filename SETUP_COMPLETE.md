- ✅ `subjects` - Subjects within each course
- ✅ `units` - Units within each subject
- ✅ `chapters` - Chapters within each unit
- ✅ `topics` - Topics within each chapter
- ✅ `new_questions` - Questions with `used_in_video` tracking
- ✅ `videos` - Video generation records

### 2. Sample Data Loaded
- IIT JAM exam with Mathematical Statistics course
- Sample question ready for testing
- All hierarchical relationships established

### 3. Complete Video Generation Pipeline

#### Step 1: Generate Script ✅
- Uses Gemini AI to create engaging educational scripts

## 🎬 Video Content Structure

Each video follows this format:

1. **Introduction** (0:00-0:05)
   - "Hello everyone, today we are going to solve a question for [EXAM_NAME] entrance exam."

2. **Question Reading** (0:05-0:25)
   - "So the question says: [QUESTION_STATEMENT]"
   - For MCQ/MSQ: Reads all options clearly

3. **Interactive Countdown** (0:25-0:30)
   - "Try solving this question on your own. I'll give you 5 seconds."
   - Visual countdown: 5...4...3...2...1
   - Question and options displayed on screen

4. **Answer Reveal** (0:30-0:35)
   - "The answer is: [ANSWER]"
   - Green checkmark animation

5. **Solution Explanation** (0:35-0:55)
   - Clear explanation from `solution` column
   - Visual highlighting of key points

6. **Call-to-Action** (0:55-1:00)
   - "If you are looking for a complete guide for [EXAM_NAME] or more practice questions, follow and comment [EXAM_NAME] and it will be in your DMs."
